A *very* simple IRC Double Puppet Bridge
========================================

This irc bridge was written to test the framework, as it's possible to run
a ircd locally and it's nice and simple to use and write.

Running
-------

This example comes with a Vagrant setup which runs both a localhost matrix
homeserver and a ircd. It is therefore possible to test this bridge by doing
`vagrant up`.
